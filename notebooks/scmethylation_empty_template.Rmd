# Introduction to notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Executing a chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

# Preparation for analysis

## Load libraries

```{r load-libs}
library(tidyverse)
library(wesanderson)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(pcaMethods)
```

## Load summarized data

Load the summarized results in `../results/all.tsv.gz`.

```{r load-data}
df <- read_tsv("../results/all.tsv.gz", col_types = cols())
df <- mutate(df, sample = gsub(".tsv.gz", "", sample))
```

Add sample metadata defining cell type.

```{r load-metadata}
df_meta <- read_delim("../data/sample_metadata.txt", col_names = FALSE, delim = " ")
colnames(df_meta) <- c("sample", "cell_type")
```

Add cell type information to methylation data frame.

```{r add-cell-type}

```

# Clustering of cells by methylation profile

We can take just the methylation rates for the active enhancer features and 
use probabilistic PCA (which can handle missing values; highly relevant here) to
view cells in a lower-dimensional space. Here we only use enhancers with less 
than 50% missing values

```{r gather-enhancers}

```

```{r pca-enhancers}

```

Here, the first principal component separates the cells by cell type (E4.5 and 
E6.5).

**EXERCISE:** Repeat this with other classes of features. Do you see the same 
results?

# Context specificity of methylation

## Mean and variance of methylation rate

Functionality from the `dplyr` package makes it easy to compute the mean and 
variance of the methylation rate across annotation categories.

### Mean and variance of methylation rate across all cells

```{r meanvar-rate}

```


Plotting the distributions of mean methylation rate across genomic features 
reveals that promoters and CpG islands are generally very lowly methylated, 
whereas repetetive elements (IAP) are frequently highly methylated. Enhancer 
regions commonly have moderate (25-50%) methylation.

```{r plot-mean-rate}

```

We can also examine the variance of methylation rate across classes of genomic 
feature. Plotting the distributions of the standard deviation of methylation 
rate by type of feature reveals that promoters and CpG islands typically have 
low variance of methylation rate, whereas methylation rate genebody and active
enhancers is highly variable. IAP elements have widely varying standard 
deviations: some elements have very low variance in methylation rate, while 
others have very high variance.

```{r plot-var-rate}

```

### Mean and variance of methylation rate by cell type

```{r meanvar-rate-cell}

```


When we compute the mean methylation rate separately for the two cell types 
(E4.5 and E6.5), we see stark differences in the distributions of mean 
methylation rate across genomic features. Particularly, active enhancers go from
almost completely unmethylated in E4.5 cells to highly methylated (most active
enhancers greater than 50% methylated) in E6.5 cells. Similarly, gene bodies are 
generally much more methylated in E6.5 cells than E4.5 cells.

In both cell types CpG islands are generally very lowly methylated, 
whereas repetetive elements (IAP) are consistently highly methylated in E6.5 
cells, but show high variation in mean methylation rate in E4.5 cells. Promoters
are generally lowly methylated, but show slightly more methylation in E6.5 cells.


```{r plot-mean-rate-cell, fig.width=5}

```

Examination of the variance of methylation rate across classes of genomic 
feature split by cell type shows similar patterns to the mean methylation rate.
Genebody and active enhancer methylation variance is higher in E6.5 cells than
E4.5 cells. IAP features are generally have less variable methylation in E6.5 
cells; in E4.5 cells, IAP elements have widely varying standard 
deviations: some elements have very low variance in methylation rate, while 
others have very high variance. Promoters have slightly higher methylation 
variance in E6.5 cells. In both cell types, CpG islands typically have very low
variance of methylation rate. 

```{r plot-var-rate-cell, fig.width=5}

```

These analyses demonstrate the context specificity of methylation variance. In 
mouse ES cells, CGIs are homogenous (and low in methylation), repeat elements 
are homogenously high in E6.5 cells and active enhancer elements are
heterogeneous. This is interesting because the enhancer elements are cell type
specific and thus some variation in the methylation levels here implies 
plasticity in cell identity which could be important for lineage formation.
